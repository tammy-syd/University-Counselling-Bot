# University-Counselling-Bot
The two files that are uploaded in this repository are the source codes for my bot.

The executable file (.exe) cannot be uploaded to Github due to its size ( 300+ MB ).
To get access to it you need to download it using this Drive link 
https://drive.google.com/file/d/181O1d-7GYTtbqn8waq_hbMXQhynWC4fD/view?usp=sharing

To use it, first unzip the file. Then click on the file name 'University Counselling Bot' in the folder.
Wait for a few seconds until a new window pops up.
Enter your desired course name and wait for the file to work.
The output file will be in the same folder.
For example, if your desired course is 'bachelor of data science', the output filename will be 'bachelor_of_data_science_course'.
